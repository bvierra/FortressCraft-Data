		<PreDescription>Your suit contains a black box that stored all sensor readings leading up to your crash on the planet. Researching this data could help you determine what exactly happened.</PreDescription>
		<PostDescription>The last status update received from the space station before you used the escape shuttle was a general Evacuation Order. No other escape shuttle appears to have been activated. The shuttle crashed from damage sustained before you boarded it. The explosions you witnessed were caused by the impact of large inert objects, possibly meteors. It is impossible to determine at this time if any other people survived. For now, you will have to assume you will be on your own.</PostDescription>

		<PreDescription>Your environmental suit is the most advanced piece of exploration engineering known to man. But its modular design was especially created so that specific parts could be upgraded or replaced. It is time to look into how you can do this away from the factories back home. You can use a bit of help surviving in this harsh environment.</PreDescription>
		<PostDescription>With some minor adjustments, it should be possible to produce suit upgrades from basic machinery design, miniaturised to be wearable. The most obvious upgrades are a better solar cell and cold insulation to operate at higher efficiency on this hostile planet.</PostDescription>
