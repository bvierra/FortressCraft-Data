					<Text>Matter Movers are a high-speed, high-energy method of moving resources around your mining operation. Utilising a massive 64 energy/item, Matter Movers can mattermit 300 items a minute a distance of up to 64m. They are simple in usage; supply with power as you would any other machine, and place them touching (but not facing) a Storage Hopper, facing towards a second Storage Hopper. The cost to mattermit is fixed, and not (currently) dependent on the item being transported, nor the distance.</Text>
