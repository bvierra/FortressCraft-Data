					<Text>Solar Panels are the simplest and easiest of the renewable power sources available to you. To use them is straightforward; just build it where it has unfettered access to the sky. Solar Panels follow all normal power generation rules; they can deliver power to a Power Storage Block, Laser Energy Transmitter or a power-using machine. Useful for 12 minutes in every 24 (Unless in Easy Mode, which allows 100% usage), they are at their peak at midday, dropping to 50% efficiency at sunset. Solar Panel can provide an excellent choice for a remote Tier-2 base, due to their self-contained nature.</Text>
